# File-Search
<br>
<p>It is very annoying when I am looking for a file but I have forgotten the location of that file I saved. I don't like to memorize the file name all the time. But I know the file extension of my required file. I don't have a good quality PC. So, sometimes my machine takes a long time to search my file when I use the deafult search option given by operating system. Now, I don't have the exact file location and the file name as well. <i> This is that moment I got fucked up ;p </i>. To resolve this problem I tried to write this script. <br> Here I have to put my file name or the extention of that file. After that it will do it's work. It will give me all the location of those similler file name or extention.</p>
